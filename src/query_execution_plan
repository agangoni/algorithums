Base tables:

sales.  50 B rows
product 100 M rows
date_dim 50 K rows

// Top 100 selling products in a 6 month time
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(sales_amount) total_sales
FROM sales s, product p, date_dim d
-- FROM sales s, date_dim d, product p
WHERE s.product_id = p.product_id and s.date_id = d.date_id
AND d.ship_date between '2020-01-01' AND '2020-06-30'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 100;


Q: How would you execute this query on a distributed cluster of N nodes ?
